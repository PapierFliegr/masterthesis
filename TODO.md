## Model 01
- [x] Existence of $ M_0 $ s.t. connected
- [x] Existence of $ M_0 $ s.t. disconnected (analogous to Fumihiko)
- [ ] Does Stickiness depend on $ R $?
- [ ] If $ R = 1 $ does there exist an $ M $ s.t. $ E = E_0 $?
- [x] Minimizer for dimension $ 1 $ (always connected)

## Model 02 
- [x] Existence of $ M_0 $ s.t. connected
  - [x] Existence of Tube (for $ R > M $)
  - [x] Show minimizing set is touching the boundary of $ \Omega $ 
- [x] Existence of $ M_0 $ s.t. disconnected (for $ R > M $) (analogous to Fumihiko)
- [ ] Behavior of Minimizer if $ R < M $
  - [ ] Always disconnected?
  - [ ] Minimizer $ E = E_0 $?
- [x] Minimizer for dimension $ 1 $ (always connected)

## General
- [ ] Think about combining both models to try modeling behavior of $ E_M $ for arbitrary
  $ E_0 $ (box approximation idea)
- [x] If we have a minimizing set $ E $ then the boundary of $ E\setminus E_0 \subset
  \Omega $ is touching the boundary of $ E_0 $? (Yes, if 2. is correct)
  - [x] 1. Minimizer $ E $ is in the convex hull of $ E_0 $? (Yes, if inequality is
    correct)
  - [x] 2. If $ d(E_0, \Omega) > 0 $ or $ | \partial E_0 \cap \partial \Omega | = 0 $,
    then $ E = E_0 $ else surface unnecessarily increased? (Yes, if inequality is correct) 
- [x] For symmetric model is the minimizer symmetric as well? (YES, see 2017
  Dipierro-Savin-Valdinoci Appendix Lemma A.1)
- [ ] Can we give an restriction of the volume of the minimizing component in $ \Omega $?
