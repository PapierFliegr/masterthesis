# Meetings

## 07.11.23 (Initial Meeting)
Fumihiko will give me a paper
Preliminaries should already be there
Stop with current paper (Mean curvature flow) (maybe later relevant)
Start easier paper (Nonlocal Minimal Surface)

### Idea
Extention of Perimeter => Fractional Perimeter kindof gives the "Area of the boundary times
some potential factor"

Fractional Perimeter is also called nonlocal perimeter, because we need to consider not
just the elements at the boundary, but also those around it (not locally anymore)

We consider problems of the type $ min P_s (E; \Omega) $ over those sets $ E $ which have
fixed boundary $ E \setminus \Omega = E_0 $ outside of $ \Omega $.
We are interested in the local perimeter problem $ min P (E; \Omega) $, but first consider
the nonlocal perimeter problem. 
Existence and Regularity proved by Caffarelli, Roquejofre and Savin in the paper (Nonlocal
Minimal Surfaces), but we don't know how those minimizer look like yet.

Expected Behavior of minimizer, see in Paper Dipierro-Savin-Valtinoci (16,17).
Interesting behavior when considering $ \Omega $ a cylinder and $ E_0 $ the halfspace.

Look up Catenoid but these only apply in $ \mathbb{R}^3 $.
See paper Dipierro-Onoue-Valtinoci.

One possible direction of my thesis:
First think about problemsetting and then Minimizer shapes.

Maybe not consider whole halfplanes, but two cylinders with radius $ R $ and let $ R $ go
to $ \infty $ (current research of Onoue).
Behavior of the minimizer as $ R $ go to $ \infty $.

### Questions

1. Q.02: Why choose for $ \Omega_{k+1} = \{ u(x,\varepsilon) > \alpha \} $, $ \alpha = 0 $
   (which increases $ \Omega_{k+1} $) and not $ \alpha = 1/2 $ which correspondences to
   motion by mean curvature, cf. Merriman etal 1992.

   Answer: 

2. Q.03: How does BM differ from Levy process, s.t. long-range correlation is considered
   in the later but not in the former?

   Answer:

3. Q.07: Why are we looking at local minimizer again? We want nonlocal minimzers?

   Answer: 

4. Q.08: Minimzier in what sense? If $ E_n \setminus B_1 = E_0 $, then $ (E_n \triangle
   E) \setminus B_1 = \emptyset $ (Don't understand rest of proof Thm 3.3)

   Answer:
