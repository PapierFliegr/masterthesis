dicussion of the results, comparison to classical case, open problems, future
work,..\\

1. Change of Topology in the models (barrier construction) \\
2. Cubic construction for arbitrary external data\\
3. Existence of \( s_{0} \) for all external data and prescribed sets\\
4. Minimizer touching the boundary of the prescribed set (Calculations with of 3. with
arbitrary parameter shows, no)\\
5. Can we give an estimate of the amount of connected components?\\
