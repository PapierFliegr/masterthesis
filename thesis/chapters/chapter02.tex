For \( n \geq 2 \) consider the model as follows:
\begin{align}
	E_0    & \coloneqq \{(x^\prime,x_n) \in \mathbb{R}^{n-1} \times \mathbb{R} \text{ s.t. } \lvert x^\prime \rvert \leq R, \, \lvert x_n \rvert \geq M \} \\
	\Omega & \coloneqq \{(x^\prime,x_n) \in \mathbb{R}^{n-1} \times \mathbb{R} \text{ s.t. } \lvert x^\prime \rvert \leq 1, \, \lvert x_n \rvert \leq M \}
\end{align}
for \( R \geq 1 \) and \( M > 0 \). The figure \cref{fig:201} illustrates the setting.

We state the following two results, which we will prove afterwards.

\begin{theorem}
	\label{thm:201}
	For \( \Omega \) and \( E_0 \) as given above and for all \( R \geq 1 \), then there
	exists \( M_0 \in (0,1) \) depending only on the dimension and \( s \), such that
	for any \( M \in (0, M_0) \), the minimizer is \( E_M = E_0 \cup \Omega \).
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
	\label{thm:202}
	For \( \Omega \) and \( E_0 \) as given above and for all \( R \geq 1 \), then there
	exists \( M_0 > 1 \) depending only on the dimension and \( s \), such that
	for any \( M \geq  M_0 \), the minimizer \( E_M \) is disconnected.
\end{theorem}

For both proofs, we follow a similar construction as in
\cite{dipierro2020disconnectedness}. \newline

\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{thm:201}] 
    Let 
\end{proof}

Intersting to see, that the contribution of the cylinder of radius \( 1 \) is enough to
get connectedness of the minimizer and even stickiness to the boundary. Also see, that the
model seems (maybe prove that) to converge to the problem, considered in
\cite{dipierro2020disconnectedness}.\newline


Proof is almost identical to the one in \cite{dipierro2020disconnectedness}, but is
included for completeness.
