\chapter{Disconnected Minimizer}
\label{ch:connected_minimizer}

Example of a minimizer that has a non-empty set in \( \Omega \), while \( d(E_{0},
\Omega) \eqqcolon d > 0  \).\newline
Compare to classical case, where this cannot happen. Refer to .. and .. where discussion
about the behavior of the perimeter for \( s \to 1^{-}  \) and \( s \to  0^{+}  \) was
done. \newline
Connect to the discussion in \cref{ch:model02}..\newline



Idea: If \( d(E_{0}, \Omega ) = 0  \), does there exist a connected component \( F \subset
E \) s.t.\ \( d(E_{0}, F) > 0 \)?
