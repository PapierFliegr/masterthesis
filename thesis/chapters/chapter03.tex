For \( n \geq 2 \) consider the model as follows:
\begin{align}
	E_0    & \coloneqq \{(x^\prime,x_n) \in \mathbb{R}^{n-1} \times \mathbb{R} \text{ s.t. } M \lvert x_n \rvert \geq R+M \} \\
	\Omega & \coloneqq \{(x^\prime,x_n) \in \mathbb{R}^{n-1} \times \mathbb{R} \text{ s.t. } \lvert x^\prime \rvert \leq 1, \, \lvert x_n \rvert \leq M \}
\end{align}
for \( R > 0 \) and \( M > 0 \). The figure.. illustrates the setting.

%TODO: include figure

We state the following two results, which we will prove afterwards.

%TODO: Specify R
\begin{theorem}
	\label{thm:301}
	Let \( \Omega \) and \( E_0 \) as given above and for all \( R >.. \), then there
	exists \( M_0 \in (0,1) \) depending only on the dimension and \( s \), such that
	for any \( M \in (0, M_0) \), the minimizer is \( E_M = E_0 \cup \Omega \). For \( R
	\leq.. \), the cylinder \( A \coloneqq \{(x^\prime,x_n) \in \mathbb{R}^{n-1} \times
	\mathbb{R} \text{ s.t.~} \lvert x^\prime \rvert \leq.., \, \lvert x_n \rvert \leq M
	\} \) is in the minimizer, i.e.\ \( E_M \supset E_0 \cup A \).
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
	\label{thm:302}
	For \( \Omega \) and \( E_0 \) as given above and for all \( R > 0 \), then there
	exists \( M_0 >.. \) depending only on the dimension and \( s \), such that
	for any \( M \geq M_0 \), the minimizer \( E_M \) is disconnected.
\end{theorem}

Again, similar proofs as in \cref{ch:model01}. \newline
Add some

	Let

Disscussion about connectedness in case of small \( R \) and refer to next chapter.
Behavior unique to nonlocal minimal surfaces.\newline
Talk about the contribution of the complement.

Discussion about extending the model to arbitrary models with symmetric external data.
Enough to consider discs of radius.. and heigth.. to have connectedness and even
stickiness at some point.\newline
New idea: If there is a minimizer \( E_M \), can it ever be non sticky to the boundary?\newline
Maybe able to give own interpretation of nonlocal minimal surfaces. Idea about Volume or
Gravity?
