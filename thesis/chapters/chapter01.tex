In 2009 Cafarelli, Roquejoffre, and Savin~\cite{caffarelli2009nonlocal} introduced a new
concept of minimal surfaces. By incooperating long-range corelations into the classical
perimeter, they defined the nonlocal perimeter as the (semi)norm of an indicator function.
Minimizing over suitable set with given external data gives us \emph{nonlocal minimal
	surfaces}. Instead\ldots
